I'm a **fullstack web developer** with **Graphic & Web Design** background & a love for anything Design or Tech. 

PHP was my first language when I created *Fansites-Wordpress/Coppermine-Themes* as a teen + discovered a passion for CSS.
10 years later I'm still exploring the front & back-end of the web. Thanks to a graduating 5 months bootcamp in 2020/2021, I'm confident to experiment with and learn new technologies 👩‍💻

I'm fun to work with, I always like to learn new things from others as much as helping others solve their problems.
